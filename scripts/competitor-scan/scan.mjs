/**
 * Rose — Competitor Feature Scanner
 *
 * Tracks product/feature announcements from legal-AI competitors:
 *   - Harvey        (harvey.ai)
 *   - Legora        (legora.com) — was "Leya" pre-Feb-2025 rebrand; same company, not tracked separately
 *   - CoCounsel     (Thomson Reuters)
 *   - Eudia         (eudia.com) — enterprise legal AI platform
 *   - Hebbia        (hebbia.com) — cross-industry document/data AI, incl. legal solution
 *   - vLex          (vlex.com, Vincent AI — part of Clio) — legal research + Studio no-code workflows
 *   - Josef         (joseflegal.com) — AU-based no-code legal automation (Q&A, contracts, workflows)
 *   - Neota Logic   (neota.com) — no-code governed AI workflow automation
 *   - Checkbox      (checkbox.ai) — AI legal front door / intake-triage automation for in-house teams
 *   - Litera        (litera.com) — Litera One / Kira / Lito: drafting, contract intelligence, KM
 *
 * Runs in parallel with the GitHub fork scan from `Start Rose.command`.
 *
 * Two-tier design (see CLAUDE.md → Competitor Scan):
 *   1. This node script (unattended, on every launch): fetches each vendor's
 *      curated blog / release-note pages, extracts candidate post links, and
 *      diffs them against the register. Genuinely new posts are appended as
 *      status:"new" entries flagged "Needs triage" so you see them immediately.
 *   2. A weekly Cloud (Claude) refresh: re-researches all three vendors with
 *      full web search, turns raw posts into properly grouped, summarised
 *      feature entries, and marks anything new. Higher fidelity than raw HTML.
 *
 * The FIRST run seeds the register from SEED_FEATURES (the curated baseline of
 * features to-date). Every run regenerates reports/latest.html + latest.md,
 * grouped by capability with vendor tags; new items are badged and filterable.
 *
 * Usage:  node scan.mjs [--open-if-new] [--open] [--reset] [--no-fetch]
 *         --no-fetch rebuilds reports/latest.html+md from the register only:
 *         no network, no scanCount bump, no new→seen aging, no register writes.

// NOTE: Eudia/Hebbia/vLex/Josef/Neota/Checkbox/Litera regexes are best-effort, built from
// a one-off fetch of each vendor's blog/news index rather than a verified long-running
// scrape (unlike Harvey/Legora/CoCounsel, which were validated over several scans). Their
// title-capture group is relaxed to {0,140} (vs. the original three's {6,140}) because
// several of these sites render card-style anchors whose first child is a nested
// <img>/<div> rather than plain text — a strict capture would fail to match the whole
// anchor (losing the URL too), not just the title; titleCaseFromSlug() already covers
// the empty-title case. This sandbox has no general outbound HTTP access (proxy blocks
// raw fetch/curl to arbitrary domains), so these were dry-run tested against sample
// markup built from real observed link structures, not against the live pages. If a
// vendor stops producing "new post" flags after a real run on your machine, check
// scanNotes / last-scan.log first — the site's markup may differ from what was sampled
// here — before assuming there's simply no news.
